# Snake-Game

This is a Snake game implementation in x86 Assembly language, featuring over 1200 lines of code. The project was created as an educational tool to demonstrate the process of compiling code into Assembly and the difficulties of coding in Assembly without the aid of higher-level languages such as C++. The game features classic Snake gameplay, where the player controls a snake that moves across the screen, eating food and growing longer, while avoiding collision with walls or its own body. The project showcases the efficiency and low-level control offered by Assembly programming, but also highlights the need for higher-level languages in modern software development.
